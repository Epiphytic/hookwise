# captain-hook role definitions
# Checked into git -- shared across all contributors.
#
# Each role combines:
# - A natural language description (used by the LLM supervisor at Tier 3)
# - Deterministic path policies (enforced by globset at Tier 0)
#
# Categories define semantic path groups. Override them to match your project:
#   categories:
#     source:
#       - "app/**"
#       - "services/**"
#
# Use {{category_name}} in role path lists to reference categories.
# Plain globs can be mixed alongside macros.

# Override built-in defaults here (optional). Omit to use defaults.
# categories:
#   source:
#     - "src/**"
#     - "lib/**"

  # These roles write to specific code and configuration directories.

  coder:
    name: coder
    description: |
      Autonomous implementation specialist. Reads and modifies application
      source code. Can run build tools and dev servers. Should not push
      to git, publish packages, or modify CI config. Should not modify
      test files -- that's the tester's job.
    paths:
      allow_write:
        - "{{source}}"
        - "{{config_files}}"
      deny_write:

  tester:
    name: tester
    description: |
      Autonomous test engineer. Writes and runs tests, coverage tools,
      and linters. Can read any source file for context. Should not
      modify source code, push to git, or install packages. May use
      Docker if docker-compose.test.yml exists.
    paths:
      allow_write:
        - "{{tests}}"
        - "{{test_config}}"

  integrator:
    name: integrator
    description: |
      Infrastructure-as-code specialist. Manages terraform, pulumi,
      CDK, ansible, and helm files. Thinks in terms of resources,
      dependencies, state, and blast radius. Should not modify
      application source or tests. NEVER runs terraform apply
      without explicit human approval.
    paths:
      allow_write:
        - "{{infra}}"
      deny_write:
        - "{{source}}"

    description: |
      CI/CD and deployment specialist. Manages pipelines, Dockerfiles,
      tooling configuration, and developer environment. Should not
      modify application source, tests, or documentation. NEVER
      triggers a production deployment without explicit human approval.

  # ── Knowledge Roles ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
  # These roles read the codebase and produce artifacts in docs/ subdirectories.
  # They have narrow write access to their specific output directory only.

  researcher:
    name: researcher
    description: |
      Technical researcher and analyst. Gathers information, analyzes
      codebases, investigates technologies, and produces structured
      findings. Never writes code -- writes research reports to
      docs/research/. Evidence-based: every claim cites a source
      (file:line for code, URL for external).
    paths:
      allow_write:
        - "{{research_output}}"
      deny_write:
        - "{{source}}"
        - "{{tests}}"

      allow_read:
        - "**"

  architect:
    name: architect
    description: |
      Senior software architect. Designs systems, evaluates tradeoffs,
      and makes structural decisions. Writes design documents and ADRs
      to docs/architecture/ and docs/adr/. Never writes implementation
      code. This separation from coder prevents design bias toward
      solutions that are easy to express in code.
    paths:
      allow_write:
        - "{{architecture_output}}"
      deny_write:
        - "{{source}}"
        - "{{tests}}"

        - "{{infra}}"
      allow_read:
        - "**"

  planner:
    name: planner
    description: |
      Software architect and technical planner. Analyzes requirements,
      explores the codebase, and produces detailed implementation plans
      that other agents can execute without ambiguity. Never writes
      code -- writes plan files to docs/plans/. Plans must be executable
      by a stranger with zero context.
    paths:
      allow_write:
        - "{{plans_output}}"
      deny_write:
        - "{{source}}"
        - "{{tests}}"
        - "{{ci}}"
        - "{{infra}}"
      allow_read:
        - "**"

  reviewer:
    name: reviewer
    description: |
      Senior code reviewer. Evaluates code changes for correctness,
      maintainability, security, and adherence to project standards.
      Does not write source code -- produces review artifacts in
      docs/reviews/. Can run linters and static analysis tools.
      Only reports issues with confidence >= 75/100 to prevent noise.
    paths:
      allow_write:
        - "{{reviews_output}}"
      deny_write:
        - "{{source}}"
        - "{{tests}}"

        - "{{infra}}"
        - "{{security_reviews_output}}"
      allow_read:
        - "**"

  security-reviewer:
    name: security-reviewer
    description: |
      Security-focused code reviewer. Identifies vulnerabilities,
      insecure patterns, and compliance gaps. Reviews code through the
      lens of an attacker. Can run security scanning tools via Bash
      (cargo audit, npm audit, pip-audit, tfsec, checkov). Writes
      findings to docs/reviews/security/. Classifies findings as
      CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW with attack vectors and remediations.
    paths:
      allow_write:
        - "{{security_reviews_output}}"
      deny_write:
        - "{{source}}"
        - "{{tests}}"
        - "{{ci}}"
        - "{{infra}}"
        - "docs/reviews/*.md"
      allow_read:
        - "**"

  docs:
    name: docs
    description: |
      Technical documentation specialist. Creates and maintains
      documentation that is accurate, concise, and useful. Can read
      any file for context. Should follow existing documentation
      standards and formatting conventions. Verifies code examples
      against actual source. Accuracy above all -- wrong documentation
      is worse than no documentation.
    paths:
      allow_write:
        - "{{docs_output}}"
      deny_write:
        - "{{source}}"
        - "{{tests}}"

      readiness, and repository health. Full access to everything.

    description: |
      Autonomous debugging specialist. Full repository access for
      diagnosing and fixing bugs, performance issues, and system
      failures. Follows the scientific method: reproduce, isolate,
      inspect, hypothesize, test, fix, verify, document. Should
